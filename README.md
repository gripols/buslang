bussed in rust ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©
============

Massive W for femboys and arch users.
A shitty no good very bad interpreter for 102 lang in rust.

## Build + Usage

Interpreter source: [src/main.rs](src/main.rs)

Download [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
Compile with `rustc main.rs` and execute with a valid buslang program.

I wrote two in [src/examples](src/examples), there will be more I swear.

## Future Additions

I'm getting around to building a version that's actually good,
with some additional features on top. Here's what version 2 will look like:

- A JIT compiler written in pure C
- Bus code conversion to C + Rust and vice versa
- YT video explaining how it works and steps I took to creating it
- Idk send a pr and if its cool I'll prob add it
